# Slidesquare
Unity 3D Arcade Game with randomly generated GameObjects.

A simple game that has no end when it comes to generating the map, has a highscore system
and the blocks are generated and moved in such way that prevents them from overlapping.
After the blocks pass the player's POV, they are automatically destroyed by a GameObject
called "Deathzone" which, on collide, destroys the GameObjects colliding with it.

Obstacle generating proportions: 90% red blocks, 10% blue blocks.
